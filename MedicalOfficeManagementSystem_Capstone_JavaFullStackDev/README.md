# Medical Office Management System

This project was completed as part of a the Software Engineering course at Arizona State University. The goal was to design and implement a full featured medical office system that simulates real world workflows, user roles, and data handling within a healthcare setting.

# Problem
Doctor's offices rely on efficient, secure, and role specific software systems to manage daily operations. The challenge was to develop a system that supports multiple user roles (doctors, nurses, patients), enforces proper access control, and facilitates tasks such as recording vitals, prescribing medication, internal messaging, and patient record keeping.

# Our Solution
Our team designed and implemented a desktop based medical office application using Java. The system features:
- Role-based login and access control
- Patient data management
- Internal messaging between staff
- Prescription tracking and documentation tools
- Custom repository structure for storing patient visit history, vitals, and notes

# Methodology
- Requirements Analysis: Used a provided medical office scenario to define user roles, workflows, and permissions. 
- Agile Project Management: Used Jira to manage user stories, track sprint progress, and meet key milestones.
- Software Design Artifacts: Developed object identification and CRC diagrams, use case descriptions, class diagrams, and prototype code to support planning and implementation.
- Software Development: Developed the application using Java and JavaFX with a modular codebase and object oriented principles.
- Testing: Performed extensive unit and workflow testing, and conducted UI walkthroughs.

# Technologies Used
- Java & JavaFX (for application logic and GUI)
- Git/GitHub (for version control)
- Jira (for Agile sprint management and issue tracking)

# Results
The project successfully delivered:
- A functioning application with distinct user flows and access levels
- A HashMap backed repository to manage and store sensitive patient data
- A user interface tailored to real world healthcare workflows
- On time sprint delivery and milestone completion through Agile practices

The project demonstrated practical experience in full-stack software development, team collaboration, secure data handling, and the use of industry tools to manage scope and quality.
