# Software & Analytics Project Portfolio

Thank you for visiting my GitHub portfolio!

This repository highlights a collection of academic/capstone projects completed as part of my Computer Systems Engineering degree at Arizona State University. These projects showcase my skills in full-stack development, UI/UX design, Agile project management, data analytics, and software engineering principles.

By organizing and publishing my work here, I hope to provide an accessible, transparent view of my technical abilities and growth as a developer and analyst. Each folder contains documentation, source code, and relevant design artifacts that demonstrate how I work with others to approach real world problems with practical, collaborative solutions.

## Projects Included

- **Medical Office Management System**  
  A desktop based application built in Java to support multi role workflows in a medical setting, including secure patient data handling and role based access control.

- **Interaction Design Capstone: RockAuto.com Redesign**  
  A usability focused redesign of RockAuto.com with user testing, Figma prototypes, and data driven evaluation to enhance navigation, clarity, and user experience.

Each project folder includes a README with additional details about the goals, technologies, and results of the work.

Feel free to explore the projects, and thank you again for taking the time to view my work!
