# Interaction Design Capstone: RockAuto.com Redesign

This project was completed as part of the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course at Arizona State University. The objective was to identify a website with existing usability issues. My team and I selected the RockAuto.com website and resolved these usability issues by applying industry-standard UI/UX principles to design and evaluate an improved user experience.

## Problem
The original RockAuto.com interface presented several challenges related to navigation clarity, visual hierarchy, and user efficiency. These issues were identified through structured heuristic evaluations and task-based testing.

## Our Solution
Our team redesigned the interface using Figma to address identified shortcomings. We applied core UI/UX principles such as:
- Nielsen's Heuristics
- Fitts’s Law
- Jakob’s Law
- Consistency and standards

The redesign focused on simplifying user navigation, clarifying product hierarchies, and improving the visual flow of the site.

## Methodology
- Usability Evaluation: Task-based testing and heuristic review of the current site.
- Prototyping: Redesigned user interfaces and implemented new features to improve workflows in Figma.
- User Testing: Conducted usability testing with real participants to measure task completion time, success rate, and record user satisfaction through a self-reporting survey on Google Forms.
- Data Analysis: Compiled results into comparative tables to assess the effectiveness of the redesigned interface.

## Technologies Used
- Figma (for design and prototyping)
- Google Forms/Sheets (for usability data collection and analysis)

## Results
User testing showed significant improvements in:
- Task completion time
- Error rates
- User satisfaction

Our findings supported the conclusion that the redesigned interface significantly enhanced usability and accessibility.
